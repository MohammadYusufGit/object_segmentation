## YOLOv8 Image Segmentation

This repository implements YOLOv8 for image segmentation tasks. It includes training, validation, and prediction scripts for segmenting a custom dataset with classes like **Cat**, **Car**, **Bottle**, **Boat**, and **Apple**. The project leverages YOLOv8's segmentation model for accurate predictions, and the code is structured for easy integration with Google Colab for cloud-based training and inference.

### Features
- **Custom Dataset**: Dataset includes classes like Cat, Car, Bottle, Boat, and Apple.
- **Training**: Train YOLOv8 on the custom segmentation dataset.
- **Validation**: Validate the model performance on a separate validation set.
- **Prediction**: Use the trained model for segmenting new images.
- **Google Colab Integration**: Code is designed to run in Google Colab for easy access to cloud resources.
